# EXPERIMENT 3 - DIIFRENTIAL AMPLIFIER 
AIM: To analyze and design the DC,AC,Transient analysis of Common Source NMOS Amplifier
# Introduction:
It is the basic configuration of the MOSFET(Metal oxide semiconductor field effective transistor) where the input is given to the gate terminal and output is driven form the drain terminal and the source is grounded .This amplifier will give the significant gain which is ideally 1 and this amplifier will act as the buffer amplifier which as 180 degree phase shift. DC Analysis is used to determine the Q point in such a way that the transistor is operating in the saturtaion region. The AC analysis is used to determine the gain, amplifiers frequency response and the bandwidth of the amplifier.

# Theory
A Differential Amplifier is an funadamental electronic circuit designed to amplify the difference between the two input signals while rejecting an Common-Mode signals that are present on the both input signals. This characteristic makes it highly effective in applications requiring noise reduction. The Differential amplifier typically consists of a pair of transistors configured in a symmetrical manner,allowing it to obtain high common-mode rejection ratio(CMMR)

# Design 

* Assume M1 and M2 are perfectly identical
* Vicm1 = Vicm2 = Vicm
* RD1 = RD2 = RD
* ID1 = ID2 = Iss/2
* VGS1 = VGS2 =VGS
* Vocm1 = Vocm2 = Vocm = 1.4V
 <br> Vicm = Vp + VGS </br>
       1.3 = 0.5 + VGS </br>
       1.3-0.5 = VGS </br>
       <table>
       <td>V<sub>GS</sub> = 0.8V</td>
       </table>
- we can conclude that VGS >= Vth , M1 and M2 are in ON state
- Given P = 3mW we can calucalate Iss
- Iss = P/VDD
- Iss = 3mW/2.5V
- Iss = 1.2mA
- we known that ID = Iss/2
       <table>
       <td>I<sub>D</sub> = 1.2mA</td>
       </table>
- Rss = Vp/I<sub>ss</sub> = 0.5/1.2m
    <table>
     <td>R<sub>ss</sub> = 0.416K</td>
     </table>
- V<sub>ocm</sub> = V<sub>DD</sub> - I<sub>D</sub>*R<sub>D</sub>
- R<sub>D</sub> = (V<sub>DD</sub> - V<sub>ocm</sub>)/I<sub>D</sub>
  - R<sub>D</sub> = (2.5 - 1.4)/0.6m
   <table>
     <td>R<sub>D</sub> = 1.833K</td>
     </table>
- we can conclude V<sub>ocm</sub> >= V<sub>GS</sub> - V<sub>th</sub>
   - V<sub>ocm</sub> = 0.8 - 0.36
   <table>
       <td>V<sub>ocm</sub> >= 0.44V</td>
      </table>
<br>Therefore M1 and M2 are in saturation region</br>

      ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5019afc3-c582-403e-b1ae-2bf3fe4e3e52)
   - we can verify by the graph
   - the wave is starting from 1.325V and reached till 2.498V
   - therefore 2.948 - 1.325 = 1.173V which is equal to the calculated value V<sub>ocm</sub>maxswing.
  
**Range of an V<sub>icm</sub>**

    <td>V<sub>GS1</sub> + Vp <= V<sub>icm</sub> <= min(V<sub>DD</sub> - (I<sub>D</sub>*R<sub>D</sub>) + V<sub>th</sub> , V<sub>DD</sub>(when one mosfet is off))</td>
  </table>
      
- **AC Analysis:**
  - we got A<sub>v</sub> = -4.99V/V
  - A<sub>vdB</sub> = 20log(A<sub>v</sub>)
  - A<sub>vdB</sub> = 20log(4.99)
  <table>
    <td>A<sub>vdB</sub> = 13.96 dB</td>
  </table>
  - we need to calculate 3dB gain
  - 3dB gain = A<sub>vdB</sub> - 3dB
  - 3dB gain = 13.96 - 3
  <table>
    <td>3dB gain = 10.96 ~ 11dB</td>

- In this circuit we need to desing the Basing Voltage V<sub>b</sub>.
- For MOSFET 3 to operate in the saturation region.
   - V<sub>GD</sub> <= V<sub>th</sub>
   - V<sub>G</sub> - V<sub>D</sub> = V<sub>th</sub>
   - V<sub>b</sub> = V<sub>th</sub> + V<sub>p</sub>
   - V<sub>b</sub> = 0.366 + 0.5
     <table>
      <td>V<sub>b</sub> = 0.866V </td>
