# Monostable Multivibrator using 555 Timer IC

##  Aim

To design a circuit using a **555 Timer IC in monostable mode** that generates a **single output pulse** of **0.5 milliseconds** duration upon receiving a trigger signal.

---

##  Theory

A **monostable multivibrator** has:
- **One stable state (LOW)**.
- **One temporary state (HIGH)**.

When a **trigger signal** (negative pulse) is applied:
- The output becomes **HIGH** for a precise time `T`.
- After time `T`, the output returns to **LOW**, waiting for the next trigger.

The duration of the HIGH output (`T`) is determined by:

Where:
- `T` = Output pulse duration in seconds
- `R` = Resistance in ohms (Ω)
- `C` = Capacitance in farads (F)

This configuration is used in:
- Delay circuits
- Pulse generators
- Debouncing mechanical switches

## ⚙️ Working Principle

1. **Default Output**: The 555 timer output is **LOW**.
2. **Triggering**: When a **negative pulse** is applied to **pin 2**, the timer output becomes **HIGH**.
3. **Timing Phase**: The capacitor starts charging through the resistor.
4. **Threshold Level**: Once capacitor voltage reaches **2/3 of Vcc**, the timer resets the output to **LOW**.
5. **Auto Reset**: The capacitor discharges internally, and the circuit waits for the next trigger.

Output time duration:
